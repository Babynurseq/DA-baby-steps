# DA-baby-steps
This is my first attempt at data analysis using excel analyze
#Objective
------
the objective of this is to try my hands on a dataset and implement my basic excel skills


#Data sourcing
-------
This data was gotten from @theoyinbooke github repository and the link was from the NG30days of learning Landing page


#Data cleaning
--------
I cleaned the data using excel on my laptop to remove duplicates and errors



#Results
------
1. 2014 had the highest discounts hence the highest number of units were sold
2. Government had the highest sales price
3. United states had the highest sales


#Recommendation
--------
more discounts would increase sales hence prices should be slightly increased to accomodate more discounts to boost sales
